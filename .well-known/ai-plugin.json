The 'metadata' includes 'title', 'type', 'source', and 'status'. Note that the documents are stored as document chunks in the database, and the \"id\" refers to the chunk, whereas the \"document_id\" is shared by all chunks of the document.  If updating or deleting an existing document, specify the \"document_id\". The plugin also supports adding and deleting references between documents, with each reference indicating a specific type of relationship.",
