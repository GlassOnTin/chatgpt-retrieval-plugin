Use it whenever a user needs to chat about anything that requires too large a context-window to be resolved in one chat.  For example, for an entire Agile project with backlogs; or to plan and write an entire novel by creating a document for the concept, child documents for a chapter plan, character list, themes, sub-plots.  Work together by suggesting further child tasks to solve the concept.",
